<h1 id="Who-should-use-them"><a href="#Who-should-use-them" class="headerlink" title="Who should use them?"></a>Who should use them?</h1><p>You should use Markdown if you need to write text that will be easily converted to HTML.</p>
<h1 id="What-can-you-do-with-them"><a href="#What-can-you-do-with-them" class="headerlink" title="What can you do with them?"></a>What can you do with them?</h1><p>You can use Markdown to create:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog Posts </li>
<li>eBooks </li>
<li>Articles </li>
<li>Emails </li>
<li>Custom Post Types </li>
<li>Comments </li>

<h1 id="When-should-they-be-used"><a href="#When-should-they-be-used" class="headerlink" title="When should they be used?"></a>When should they be used?</h1><p>Markdown can be used in a number of ways, but it is most commonly used as a lightweight markup language. This means that it can be used to format text without needing to use a full-fledged word processor or HTML editor.</p>
<p>This makes it perfect for quickly creating simple documents, such as blog posts or articles. It can also be used for more complex tasks, such as creating entire websites.</p>
<p>When using Markdown for more complex tasks, it’s important to be aware of the limitations of the language. For example, it isn’t as versatile as HTML and doesn’t support all the features of a full-fledged word processor.</p>
<p> However, for most basic formatting needs, Markdown is an excellent option that is both easy to learn and use.</p>
<h1 id="Where-can-you-find-them"><a href="#Where-can-you-find-them" class="headerlink" title="Where can you find them?"></a>Where can you find them?</h1><p>The best place to find natural diamonds is in a country where diamond mining is big business. For example, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Russia, Botswana and Australia are all great places to find diamonds. If you’re looking for an uncut or rough diamond, you’ll have better luck in these countries than in a place like India, where most diamonds are cut and polished.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-they-look-like"><a href="#What-do-they-look-like" class="headerlink" title="What do they look like?"></a>What do they look like?</h1><p>Diamonds come in all shapes and sizes, but most are around the size of a pea. They can be clear or have a range of colors, depending on their origin. Some diamonds even glow in the dark!</p>
<h1 id="How-are-they-mined"><a href="#How-are-they-mined" class="headerlink" title="How are they mined?"></a>How are they mined?</h1><p>Diamonds are typically mined using large machines that dig deep into the earth. Once they’re found, the miners will often use explosives to get them out of the ground. It’s a dangerous job, but it can be very lucrative!</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-benefits-of-using-them"><a href="#What-are-the-benefits-of-using-them" class="headerlink" title="What are the benefits of using them?"></a>What are the benefits of using them?</h1><p>There are many benefits of using markdown for content creation. Some of the key benefits include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ease of use - Markdown is easy to use and can be learned in a matter of minutes. This makes it ideal for writers who are not familiar with coding languages.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Portability - Markdown files are easily portable and can be opened in any text editor. This makes them ideal for creating blog posts, articles, and other content that needs to be published online.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Readability - Markdown files are easy to read and understand. This makes them ideal for content that needs to be quickly and easily consumed by readers.</p>
</li>
